Something I came up with for fun in the span of a couple hours.

It's a browser based game made entirely in javascript. You can generate resources, like a wimp, or go mine some copper ore, smelt it, and then make a sword, or an axe. Then go sell it. This is more of a proof of concept/v0.0.0.0.1 of a future project i'm thinking of. 

Might never finish it, but I'm having fun with it.
might get updates
Fairly simple, but I'm proud of it.# browser_blacksmithing
